# NetworkCloud Agent - Project Context

This document provides context for Cursor AI about the NetworkCloud project and what we're building.

---

## What is NetworkCloud?

NetworkCloud is a web-based network monitoring application that allows users to view and track devices on their local networks from anywhere. Think of it as a "remote view" into your home or office network.

### The Problem We're Solving

- Users want to see what devices are connected to their network
- They want to check device status (online/offline) remotely
- They need to see IP addresses for remote access or troubleshooting
- Traditional network tools require being on the same network

### Our Solution

A two-part system:
1. **Web Application** (already built) - Hosted dashboard for viewing devices
2. **Local Agent** (what you're building) - Windows service that discovers devices and reports to the web app

## The Agent's Role

The agent is the "eyes" on the local network. It:

1. **Runs continuously** as a Windows Service
2. **Scans the network** every 60 seconds
3. **Discovers devices** using ping sweep and ARP table
4. **Reports to the cloud** via secure HTTPS API
5. **Authenticates** using a token generated in the web dashboard

### What the Agent Does NOT Do

- Does NOT serve any UI (the web app does that)
- Does NOT store data permanently (the web app's database does)
- Does NOT require user interaction after initial setup
- Does NOT need to handle multiple users (one agent = one user's network)

---

## User Journey

1. User signs up on NetworkCloud web app (Google login)
2. User creates an "Agent Token" in the dashboard
3. User downloads/installs the agent on a Windows PC on their network
4. User configures the agent with their token
5. User starts the agent (runs as Windows Service)
6. **Agent sends first heartbeat → appears in dashboard as "Pending Approval"**
7. **User sees agent details (hostname, MAC, IP) and clicks "Approve"**
8. Agent receives approval → begins syncing devices
9. User views devices in the web dashboard from anywhere

### Security Flow

- When agent first connects, user must approve it before it can sync devices
- Dashboard shows: hostname, MAC address, IP of the connecting agent
- If a different device tries to use the same token → "Device Mismatch" warning
- User can reject suspicious connections or revoke the token entirely

---

## Technical Details

### Web App (Already Built)

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Replit Auth (Google OAuth)
- **Hosting**: Replit
- **Domain**: networkcloud.tech (planned)

### Agent (What You're Building)

- **Language**: Go
- **Platform**: Windows (primary), potentially macOS/Linux later
- **Deployment**: Windows Service
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (no Npcap required)
- **Config**: YAML file

---

## API Contract Summary

The agent communicates with these endpoints:

### Authentication
```
Authorization: Bearer nc_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Token is created in web dashboard and stored in agent's config.yaml.

### Heartbeat
```
POST /api/agent/heartbeat
← { "macAddress": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF", "hostname": "DESKTOP-HOME", "ipAddress": "192.168.1.50" }
→ { "status": "ok" | "pending_approval" | "device_mismatch", "serverTime": "...", "message": "..." }
```
Registers agent identity and checks approval status:
- `ok` → Approved, proceed with device sync
- `pending_approval` → Waiting for user to approve in dashboard
- `device_mismatch` → Different device using this token (security warning)

### Sync Devices
```
PUT /api/agent/devices/sync
← { "devices": [...] }
→ { "created": N, "updated": N, "deleted": N }
```
Reports all discovered devices. The API automatically:
- Creates new devices not seen before
- Updates existing devices (by MAC address match)
- Deletes devices not in the list (device went offline/removed)

### Full API Documentation
See `../docs/AGENT_API.md` for complete endpoint details.

---

## Data Model

### Device (what the agent reports)
```
{
  "name": "DESKTOP-ABC123",     // Hostname or friendly name
  "macAddress": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",  // Hardware address
  "status": "online",           // online, offline, or away
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100"  // Current IP address
}
```

### What Makes Devices Unique
MAC address is the primary identifier. When syncing:
- Same MAC = update existing device
- New MAC = create new device
- Missing MAC (from previous sync) = device deleted

---

## Design Philosophy

### Simplicity First
- No complex dependencies (no Npcap, no admin consoles)
- Single executable for easy distribution
- YAML config for easy editing

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling (don't crash on network issues)
- Retry logic for API failures
- Clean shutdown when stopping service

### Security
- Token-based authentication (no username/password)
- HTTPS only for API communication
- Tokens hashed in database (can't be recovered if lost)

### User Experience
- Set it and forget it (runs as background service)
- Auto-start on Windows boot
- Minimal resource usage

---

## Success Criteria

The agent is "done" when:

1. ✅ Installs as Windows Service with simple command
2. ✅ Automatically starts on Windows boot
3. ✅ Scans local network and discovers devices
4. ✅ Reports devices to NetworkCloud API
5. ✅ Handles network/API errors gracefully
6. ✅ Runs indefinitely without memory leaks or crashes
7. ✅ Can be cleanly stopped and uninstalled
8. ✅ Works without any additional software installation

---

## Development Approach

### Build Order (Recommended)

1. **Configuration** - Load settings from YAML file
2. **API Client** - Connect to NetworkCloud API, heartbeat
3. **Network Scanner** - Discover devices on local network
4. **Main Loop** - Combine scanning and reporting
5. **Windows Service** - Wrap in service for production

### Testing Strategy

1. Test each component in isolation
2. Test full flow in foreground mode (`agent.exe run`)
3. Verify devices appear in web dashboard
4. Test service install/start/stop/uninstall cycle
5. Test error scenarios (no network, bad token, API down)

---

## Questions to Consider

As you build, think about:

1. **What if the network is down?** → Queue data? Skip cycle?
2. **What if the API is slow?** → Timeout and retry?
3. **What if a device has no hostname?** → Use "Unknown" or IP?
4. **What if MAC format varies?** → Normalize to AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
5. **What if config file is missing?** → Error message with setup instructions

|------|---------|
| `../docs/AGENT_API.md` | Complete API documentation |
| `../docs/AGENT_BUILD_GUIDE.md` | Build instructions and coding rules |
| `config.example.yaml` | Sample configuration (create this) |
| `README.md` | Agent-specific usage instructions (create this) |

## Let's Build!

Start with the configuration loader, then the API client. Once you can send a heartbeat, add network scanning. Finally, wrap it all in a Windows Service.

Good luck! 🚀
